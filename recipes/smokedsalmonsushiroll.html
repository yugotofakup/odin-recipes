    <p> Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. 
        This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, 
        but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!
    </p> 
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
        <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p> Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. 
        Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p> Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; 
        spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p> Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, 
        leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. 
        This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, 
        and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p> lightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. 
        Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</p>
