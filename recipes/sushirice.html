    <h2>What is Shushi Rice?</h2>
    <p>Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. 
        It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, 
        cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls
    </p>

    <p>GMeanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool, then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.</p>
